**If you have any questions you can easily find me in telegram @Naza_skor**

~~And I'll prove that project is working on my local machine perfectly~~

Gems used:
- Guard, Guard-livereload, Devise for authentication and user setup
- Bulma rails for frontend part

To start working after checking out repository, creating database, downloading all gems and others, ~~you know it mush better, than me~~ you must add some initial categories using console (See correct column names in db/schema.rb file). After that it sould be working ~~I hope~~

Main features
- Basic CRUD for posts
- Registration for users
- User can edit/delete only his/her own posts
- Unregistered user can also see all posts
- Filtering by categories

I hope everything will be okay, and I'll get high mark (19 or maybe 20 :).

To sum up, I would like to say that it was really exciting to code using Ruby and Rails, and your videos on YouTube helped me a lot too.
